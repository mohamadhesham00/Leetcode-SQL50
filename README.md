# LeetCode SQL 50 Solutions with SQL Server

This repository contains my solutions to the **Top 50 Leetcode SQL problems** solved using **SQL Server** syntax. Each solution focuses on clear, efficient, and maintainable SQL queries that solve the challenge as stated on LeetCode.

## About the Challenges

Leetcode’s SQL questions cover a variety of topics such as querying, joins, filtering, aggregation, window functions, and more. The goal is to practice and master SQL query writing, logical thinking, and performance considerations.

## Structure of This Repository

- **`/solutions`**: Contains a `.sql` file for each LeetCode SQL challenge. The file name usually corresponds to the problem title or ID from LeetCode.
- **`README.md`**: This guide and reference to the repository’s structure.

## Running the Queries

**Prerequisites:**
- A working installation of **SQL Server** (e.g., SQL Server, Azure Data Studio, or SQL Server Management Studio).
- The sample tables and data as provided by LeetCode’s problem statements. You may need to recreate these tables locally.

**Steps:**
1. Open the corresponding `.sql` file from the `solutions` folder.
2. Create the schema, tables, and insert sample data as described in the problem’s setup.
3. Run the solution query in your SQL Server environment.
4. Compare the output with the expected results mentioned in the problem statement.
